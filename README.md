# Encyclopedia Developer Profile UI

We were provided with the UI as an image (png format), which we converted into a web page using just HTML and CSS. We both wrote the HTML and CSS. Yu created the UI from top up to the section "You Have Likely Benefited from Paul's Work and Altruism" while Joseph created the rest, that is from "Biograph" down to the section where there are tweets, articles, and comments and answers.

To work on this project, we used Git and Github. Joseph created the initial repository and added Yu as a collaborator.
